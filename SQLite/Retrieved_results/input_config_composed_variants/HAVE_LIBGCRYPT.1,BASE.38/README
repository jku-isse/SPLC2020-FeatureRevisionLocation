The libSSH and its client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1* Why ?
-_-_-_-_-_

Why not ? :) I've began to work on my own implementation of the ssh protocol
because i didn't like the currently public ones.
Not any allow you to import and use the functions as a library, and so i
worked on a library-based SSH implementation.


2* How/Who ?
-_-_-_-_-_-_-_

If you downloaded this file, you must know what it is : a library for
accessing ssh client services through C libraries calls in a simple manner.
The client is there as a programming example and isn't at all doing its job
correctly (doesn't verify public key hashes with the ones in ~/.ssh/ 
and doesn't handle TERM - yet)
Everybody can use this software under the terms of the LGPL - see the COPYING
file

3* What ?
-_-_-_-_-_

The SSH library features :
-Full C library functions for manipulating a client-side SSH connection
-Fully configurable sessions
-Support for AES-128,AES-192,AES-256,blowfish, in cbc mode
-use multiple SSH connections in a same process, at same time.
-usable SFTP implementation
-Public key and password authentication

4* Where ?
