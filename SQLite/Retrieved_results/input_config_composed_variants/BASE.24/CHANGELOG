libssh-0.11-dev
-server implementation development. I won't document it before it even works.
-small bug corrected when connecting to sun ssh servers.
-channel wierdness corrected (writing huge data packets)
-channel_read_nonblocking added
-channel bug where stderr wasn't correctly read fixed.
-sftp_file_set_nonblocking added. It's now possible to have nonblocking SFTP IO
-connect_status callback.
-priv.h contains the internal functions, libssh.h the public interface
-options_set_timeout (thx marcelo) really working.
-tcp tunneling through channel_open_forward.
-channel_request_exec()
-channel_request_env()
-ssh_get_pubkey_hash()
-ssh_is_server_known()
-ssh_write_known_host()
-options_set_ssh_dir
-how could this happen ! there weren't any channel_close !
-nasty channel_free bug resolved.
-removed the unsigned long all around the code. use only u8,u32 & u64.
-it now compiles and runs under amd64 !
-channel_request_pty_size
-channel_change_pty_size
-options_copy()
-ported the doc to an HTML file.
-small bugfix in packet.c
-prefixed error constants with SSH_
-sftp_stat, sftp_lstat, sftp_fstat. thanks Michel Bardiaux for the patch.
-again channel number mismatch fixed.
-fixed a bug in ssh_select making the select fail when a signal has been caught.
-keyboard-interactive authentication working.

5th march 2004 : libssh-0.1
-Begining of sftp subsystem implementation. It's stable enough to be used :)
-some cleanup into channels implementation
-Now every channel functions is called by its CHANNEL handler. no any way to play again with numbers.
-added channel_poll() and channel_read(). Now, it's possible to manipulate channel streams only with channel_read() and channel_write(),
with help of channel_poll().
-changed the client so it uses the new channel_poll and channel_read interface
-small use-after-free bug with channels resolved, and a noninitialised data of SIGNATURE struct.
-changed stupidities in lot of function names.
-removed a debug output file opened by default.
-Added API.txt, the libssh programmer handbook. (I hate documentation)
-Various bug fixes from Nick Zitzmann. Thank to him, libssh now runs under macosX !
-Developed a cryptographic structure for handling protocols. Adding a custom-based cipher should be the story of thirty
minutes. It now supports aes-256,aes-192,aes-128 and blowfish-128 !
-An autoconf script which took me half of a day to set up. Respect it!
-A ssh_select wrapper has been written.
It all means the API has changed. not a lot but enough to be incompatible with anything which has been written.

10th october 2003 : libssh-0.0.4
-some terminal code (eof handling) added
-channels bugfix (it still needs some tweaking though)
-zlib support
-added a wrapper.c file. The goal is to provide a similar API to every cryptographic functions. bignums and sha/md5 are wrapped now.
-more work than it first looks.
-Support for other crypto libs planed (lighter libs)
-Fixed stupid select() bug.
-libssh now compiles and links with openssl 0.9.6 (but you're advised to upgrade)
-RSA pubkey authentication code now works !

15th september 2003 : libssh-0.0.3
-added install target in makefile
-some cleanup in headers files and source code
-change default banner and project name to libssh.
-new file auth.c to support more and more authentication ways
-bugfix(read offbyone) in send_kex
-a base64 parser. don't read the source, it's awful. pure 0xbadc0de.
-changed the client filename to "ssh". logic isn't it ?
-dss publickey authentication ! still need to wait for the rsa one
-bugfix in packet.c : now packet are completely read (and read blocks if waiting the packet)
-new misc.c contains misc functions

3rd september 2003: libssh-0.0.2
  initial release.
-client supports both ssh and dss hostkey verification, but doesn't compare
them to openssh's files. (~/.ssh/known_hosts)
-the only supported authentication method is password.
-compiles on linux and openbsd. freebsd and netbsd should work, too
-Lot of work which hasn't been discussed here.
