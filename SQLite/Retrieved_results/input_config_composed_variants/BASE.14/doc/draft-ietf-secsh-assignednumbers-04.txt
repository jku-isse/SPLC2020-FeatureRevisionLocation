Abstract

   This document defines the initial state of the IANA assigned numbers
   for the SSH protocol as defined in [SSH-ARCH], [SSH-TRANS], [SSH-
   CONNECT], [SSH-USERAUTH].  Except for one HISTORIC algorithm
   generally regarded as obsolete, this document does not define any new
   protocols or any number ranges not already defined in the above
   referenced documents.  It is intended only for initalization of the
   IANA databases referenced in those documents.

Internet-Draft        SSH Protocol Assigned Numbers          August 2003


1. Message Numbers

   The Message Number is an 8-bit value, which describes the payload of
   a packet.

   Protocol packets have message numbers in the range 1 to 255.  These
   numbers have been allocated as follows in [SSH-ARCH]:

     Transport layer protocol:

       1 to 19    Transport layer generic (e.g. disconnect, ignore, debug, etc.)
       20 to 29   Algorithm negotiation
       30 to 49   Key exchange method specific (numbers can be reused for
                  different authentication methods)

     User authentication protocol:

       50 to 59   User authentication generic
       60 to 79   User authentication method specific (numbers can be
                  reused for different authentication methods)

     Connection protocol:

       80 to 89   Connection protocol generic
       90 to 127  Channel related messages

     Reserved for client protocols:

       128 to 191 Reserved

     Local extensions:

       192 to 255 Local extensions


   Requests for assignments of new message numbers must be accompanied
   by an RFC which describes the new packet type.  If the RFC is not on
   the standards-track (i.e.  it is an informational or experimental
   RFC), it must be explicitly reviewed and approved by the IESG before
   the RFC is published and the message number is assigned.

   The Disconnect code is an 8-bit value, which describes the disconnect
   reason.  Requests for assignments of new disconnect codes must be
