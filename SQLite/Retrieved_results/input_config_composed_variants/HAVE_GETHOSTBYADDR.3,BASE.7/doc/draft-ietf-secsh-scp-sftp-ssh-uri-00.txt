Abstract

   This document describes the Uniform Resource Identifiers used to
   locate resources for the SCP, SFTP, and SSH protocols.  The document
   describes the generic syntax involved in URI definitions as well as
   specific definitions for each protocol.  These specific definitions
   may include user credentials such as username and password and also
   may include other parameters such as fingerprint.  In addition, 
   security considerations and examples are also provided within this
   document.


General Syntax

   The URI for each protocol shall consist of the scheme and the scheme
   specific portion separated by a colon ":", as discussed in RFC 2396
   [1].  This specification shall adopt the definitions "port", "host",
   "scheme", "userinfo", and "authority" from RFC 2396.

Internet Draft             SCP/SFTP/SSH URI Format       August 8, 2003
  
SSH URI

   The SSH scheme shall consist of the protocol acronym followed by a
   colon ":" and a double slash "//" in accordance with RFC 2718 [2].  

   The first component of the scheme specific portion MAY include
   credentials (userinfo) consisting of a username and optionally also 
   including a password.  Including the password in the URL is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  The username and password components are separated by
   a single colon ":".

   Following the userinfo, if present, the at-sign "@" shall
   precede the authority section of the URI.  Optionally, the
   authority section MAY also include the port preceded by a colon ":".
   If the port is not included, port 22 is assumed.  Following the port
   additional parameters may be specified.  These parameters are
   defined in the connection parameters section.

   ssh_URI = "ssh://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
      [;conn-parameter=value]

SCP and SFTP URI

   For SCP and SFTP, the scheme portion (scp: or sftp:) is followed by
   a double slash "//".

   Both SCP and SFTP URLs are terminated by a single slash "/" followed
   by the path information to the requested resource.

   The first component of the scheme specific portion MAY include
   credentials (userinfo) consisting of a username and optionally also
   including a password.  Including the password in the URL is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  The username and password components are separated by
   a single colon ":".

   Following the userinfo, if present, the at-sign "@" shall precede
   the authority section of the URL.  Optionally, the authority section
   MAY also include the port preceded by a colon ":".  If the port is
   not included, port 22 is assumed.  Following the port additional
   parameters may be specified.  These parameters are defined in the
   connection parameters section.

   scp_URI = "scp://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ] 
      [ ; parameter = value ] [ abs_path ]

   Following the port additional parameters may be specified.  These
   parameters are defined in the connection parameters section. 
   Following the path additional sftp specific parameters may be
   specified.
   
   sftp_URI = "sftp://" [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
      [;conn-parameter=value] [ abs_path ] [;sftp-parameter=value]

Parameters

SSH connection parameters

   The following parameters are associated with an SSH connection and
   are applicable to SSH, SFTP and SCP.  All parameters are optional
   and MUST NOT overwrite configured defaults.  Individual parameters
   are separated by a comma (",").

fingerprint

   The fingerprint parameter contains the fingerprint of the host key 
   for the host specified in the URL.  The fingerprint is encoded as 
   in [3].  This parameter MUST NOT overwrite a key that is already
   configured for the host.  They fingerprint MAY be used to validate
   the authenticity of the host key if the URL was obtained from an
   authenticated source with its integrity protected.  If this
   parameter is not included then the validity of the host key is 
   validated using another method.  See Security Considerations section
   for additional considerations.  There MUST be only one fingerprint 
   parameter for a given URL.

cipher

   The cipher parameter indicates an acceptable encryption mechanism to
   use in making the connection.  The value is the string specifying the
   SSH cipher type. This parameter MUST NOT add a mechanism to a 
   configured list of default configured acceptable encryption types.  
   If this parameter is not specified then the default configured cipher
   list is used.  There may be more than one cipher parameter.

integrity

   The integrity parameter indicates an acceptable data integrity
   mechanism to use in making the connection. The value is the string
   specifying the SSH data integrity type. This parameter MUST NOT add
   a mechanism to a configured list of default configured acceptable
   data integrity types.  If this parameter is not specified then the
   default configured data integrity list is used. There may be more
   than one integrity parameter.

key-xchg

   The key-xchg parameter indicates an acceptable key exchange mechanism
   to use when making the connection.  The value is the string
   specifying the SSH key exchange type. This parameter MUST NOT add a
   mechanism to a configured list of default configured acceptable key
   exchange types.  If this parameter is not specified then the default
   configured key exchange list is used.  There may be more than one
   key-xchg parameter.

host-key-alg

   The host-key-alg parameter indicates an host key to use when making
   the connection.  The value is the string specifying the SSH host key
   type.  This parameter MUST NOT add a mechanism to a configured list
   of default configured acceptable host key types.  If this parameter
   is not specified then the default configured host key type list is
   used.  There may be more than one host-key-alg parameter.

user-auth

   The user-auth parameter indicates a user authentication mechanism to
   use when making the connection.  The value is the string specifying
   the SSH user authentication mechanism type. This parameter MUST NOT
   add a mechanism to a configured list of default configured
   acceptable user authentication mechanism types.  If this parameter
   is not specified then the default configured user authentication
   mechanism type list is used.  There may be more than one user-auth
   parameter.

SFTP Parameters

   The SFTP parameters determine how to handle the file transfer
   character translation.

newline

   The newline parameter determines how the server translates new line
   indicators.  The possible choices are usually "\r" or "\n" or "\r\n".
   The default is "\r\n".

typecode

   The typecode identifies the type of file which determines how it
   will be treated. Possible values are "i" for binary files, "a" for
   text files, and "d" for directory listings.


Examples

   The following section shows basic examples of URLs for each
   protocol.  This section should not be considered to include all
   possible combinations of URLs for each protocol.
 
      ssh://user@host

      ssh://user@host:2222

      ssh://joeuser@example.com;fingerprint=c1:b1:30:29:d7:b8:de:6c
          :97:77:10:d7:46:41:63:87,cipher=aes-cbc
      
      scp://user:password@host/file.txt

      sftp://user@host/dir/path/file.txt

Internet Draft             SCP/SFTP/SSH URI Format       August 8, 2003

      sftp://joeuser@example.com:2222;fingerprint=c1:b1:30:29:d7:b8
          :de:6c:97:77:10:d7:46:41:63:87,cipher=
          aes-cbc/pub/docs/test.txt;typecode=a


Security Considerations

   In general, URIs themselves have no security considerations.
   However, since the password for each scheme can optionally be
   included within the URL it should be noted that doing so poses a
   security risk.  Since URLs are usually sent in the clear with no
   encryption or other security, any password or other credentials
   (userinfo) included could be seen by a potential attacker.

   The fingerprint should only be used to validate the host key only if
   the URL can be determined to be authentic from a trusted entity.
   For example, the URL may be received through secure email or HTTPS
   from a trusted and verifiable source.  It is possible that the SSH 
   implementation may not be able to determine if the URL is authentic 
   in which case it SHOULD prompt the user to either allow or disallow
   the connection based on the information provided.  The SSH
   implementation MUST NOT overwrite a currently configured public key
   based on the URL alone.

   The other connection parameters MUST NOT add any mechanism to the
   list of configured acceptable mechanisms defined in the SSH client.
